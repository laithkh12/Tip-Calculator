## üîç Code Overview

The code takes user inputs for the total bill, tip percentage, and number of people splitting the bill. It calculates the tip amount, the total bill with the tip included, and finally, the amount each person has to pay.

### Code Snippet

```python
print("Welcome to Tip Calculator!")
totalBill = float(input("What was the total bill?\n$ "))
tipPercentage = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give 10, 12, or 15?\n$ "))
peopleNumber = int(input("How many people to split the bill?\n"))

tipPer = tipPercentage / 100
tipAmount = totalBill * tipPer
totalBillWithTip = totalBill + tipAmount

finalBillPerPerson = totalBillWithTip / peopleNumber

print(f'The bill for each person is: {round(finalBillPerPerson, 2)}')
```
